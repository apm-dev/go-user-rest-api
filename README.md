# Go User CRUD
**User CRUD Rest API with Go and MySQL**

Libraries:
- [Gin Web HTTP framework](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Go Validator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10)
- [Go mysql driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)

this project is a simple Restful CRUD, it needs many refactors and I'll do it once in a while,
and I'll be happy if you send pull requests ;)
